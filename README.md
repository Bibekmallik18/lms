# My Learning Management System Project

I'm starting a project to build out a Learning Management System (LMS) in Python. This will involve the following:

1. User interface (probably built with Flask)
2. Admin interface (also Flask)
3. Course building module (Flask)
4. Grade calculation module (Python)
5. Grade storage, user info storage (MySQL)
6. Reporting interface (Flask)

This list will be updated as the project changes.
